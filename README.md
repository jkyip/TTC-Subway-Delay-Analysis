Author: Chun Ki Yip

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the project "A Statistical Modelling of the TTC Subway Delays Times." This analysis utilizes statistical techniques, including Multiple Linear Regression, to predict average delay times of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system. By investigating relationships between delay occurrences, day of the week, and delay times, this project aims to provide insights for improved commute planning.
